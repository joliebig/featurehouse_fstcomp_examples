The EmailSystem case study differs slightly from the other FeatureHouse case studies. It separates the features that implement the email system (stored in folder 'src') from the test cases, which simulate feature interaction scenarios (stored in 'interaction-tests'). To compose the features and compile the test cases, please use the ant build scripts in the corresponding test case subfolders. The build scripts invoke FeatureHouse and the C compiler. You may have to adjust the path to FeatureHouse.jar in target 'compose'. For more information on the email system's features and the feature interaction scenarios, please have a look at: Robert J. Hall, "Fundamental Nonmodularity in Electronic Mail", Automated Software Engineering, 12(1):41--79, 2005.
