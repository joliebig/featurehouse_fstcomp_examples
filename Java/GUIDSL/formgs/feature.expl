formgs defines the code that converts a gspec representation
of a grammar into a set of propositional logic formulas (ala
bexpr), one per pattern and one per production.  thus, the 
propositional formula for a grammar is the conjuction of
all formulas in the Ptable (production table) and the Ttable
(patTern table) and the (root=true) formula.
