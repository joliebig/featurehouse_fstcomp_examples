this layer does the following: it displays a Satsolver GUI
that will allow users to run satisfiability tests on the model.
(The Gui is in ModelDebuggerGui.jak).  The model predicate
is converted into a CNF format, along with the additional
clauses of the satisfiability tests.  The sat4j solver is
invoked, and the output is displayed in the GUI window.

Most of the files define extensions to bexpr to convert
a node expression into a cnf format.
