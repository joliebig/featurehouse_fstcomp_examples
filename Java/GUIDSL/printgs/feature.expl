printgs is a utility layer that allows a developer to debug
a gspec "database".  the debugActions method of Main is
extended to "print" a gspec database.

The way this works is that print.jak defines a visitor over 
a gspec database.  the debugActions are to create a print visitor
and to walk gspec objects.  

This layer should be optional.

The next layer should be ltmsgs.
