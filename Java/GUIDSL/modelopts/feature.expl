.m grammars require tokens to have all uppercase names.
Most layers in AHEAD do not satisfy this requirement.
This layer is invoked if the -m command-line option is selected.
It scans the model directory looking for layer names.  If
an uppercase conversion of this name matches that of a token,
the token's display name will be that of a layer.  Further,
if there is a help.html or feature.expl file in that layer,
the helpfile or help string will be assigned to this token.
