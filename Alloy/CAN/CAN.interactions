Load measurement requires the CANâ€™s
key-value space to consist of only a single partition. Otherwise,
the load measurement does not calculate the average load
correctly since it relies on the standard routing mechanism,
which cannot route between multiple partitions. The assertion (feature-based
specification) in feature LoadMeasurement allows the AlloyAnalyzer to detect
the problem.

Furthermore, the load-measurement feature and the maliciouspeers
feature interact such that we had to adjust a function
that calculates the overall number of data items. 
The reason is that malicious peers do not respond to queries even
though they own data items of interest. So, to calculate the
correct number of data items, we have to ignore malicious
peers. A similar interaction occurs between the item-retrieval
feature and the malicious-peers feature. We
have implemented two derivatives to resolve the interactions.
FeatureAlloy helped in both cases: interactions are detected
with assertions and derivatives are modeled in distinct units.
The assertions are not feature-based as they have knowledge of both
features involved in the interaction.
