@Contact: marius00@users.sourceforge.net (or Marius Marin @ SWERL, TU Delft)

Changes in the original code are (typically) indicated by a "@AJHD" comment. 

As for version 0.4 the refactoring is structured and conducted by the
documentation of concerns in SoQueT (http://swerl.tudelft.nl/view/AMR/SoQueT).

version - 0.4 
*************

- The package organization for the aspect code has been revised, based on the 
documentation of the concerns in SoQueT. The aspects go under 
org.jhotdraw.ccconcerns and will be orgranized on a 
feature/sub-feature/(collection of ) concerns(/sort instances) basis. 
An aspect file can comprise the refactoring of several sort instances like, 
for example, CommandContracts that takes care of both pre- and post- command 
execution checks/notification. However, a refactoring step deals with one sort 
instance only - the sort instances just share the host aspect (file).

- Changes due to aspected refactoring are annotated: @AJHD

- This version includes refactoring of crosscutting concerns in Command and Undo support.
