---------------------
@for questions and problems reports please contact: marius00@users.sourceforge.net (or Marius Marin @ SWERL, TU Delft)

1. Using Eclipse

Create an AspectJ project in Eclipse and call it: AJHotDraw .
Import in your project the sources in the AJHotDraw distribution - set the Java build path to: AJHotDraw/src/aspects.
For the required libraries see the libraries.txt file.

2.

Set properly your properties files in the "build" folder. Use an example one
of the files provided: /build/${user_name}.build.properties

See what external libraries are needed (also for JHotDraw) in /doc/libraries.txt.

From the project's home (AJHotDraw), run the ant build file:
ant -buildfile build/build.xml 

Examples of tasks:
ant -buildfile build/build.xml clean : cleans the generated output
ant -buildfile build/build.xml : compiles the project and builds the output jar file
ant -buildfile build/build.xml javadraw : runs one of the examples, the javadraw app.
