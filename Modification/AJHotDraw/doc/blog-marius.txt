Note: 
When running the examples, the target directory 
(instead of the jar file) should be
indicated as a path element , in order
for the app. to "find" the images in the <i>Images</i> menu.
See also the comment in the build file and, if needed, make the 
change accordingly.

The same problem occurs in the original version (jhotdraw60b1).
