  * Workaround for incomplete screen updates bug
  The bug was that after you'd run an external program, the screen would no longer be updated correctly. A bit of stracing showed that write()s were failing with EAGAIN, because rawSystem/system puts fd 0 (and thus fd 1 too) into O_NONBLOCK mode just before the vfork() (looks like it's using the "stdin" handle, which has that effect). This looks to me like a GHC bug, or at least a GHC incompatibility with curses.
  
  Anyway, here's a workaround: forcibly turn nonblocking mode off again after rawSystem returns. The FD's still in nonblocking mode while the editor runs, though, so if you're using an editor that isn't careful with its write()s it'll still get confused...
